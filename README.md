## The Why and Beyond 🚀

In my quest to supercharge my portfolio and kickstart my journey to becoming a 10x software engineer (LOL, check out this funny YouTube video for context: [10x Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKAue9DiHc0) 🎥), I decided to dive into mobile development. After some research on the best tech stack to begin with, I chose to focus on Android development. Despite my deep roots in the Apple ecosystem 🍎 (the first phone I ever owned was an Android 📱), I felt drawn back to Android. I discovered a treasure trove of resources in the "Android Basics with Compose" course, which you can explore here: [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) 📚. I haven’t found anything as comprehensive for other tech stacks like Flutter, React Native, or even Swift. If you come across something comparable, do let me know!

A lot of the material here is inspired by Google Developer's "Android Basics with Compose" course. Jetpack Compose is truly amazing! 💻✨ Check out my Google Developer profile here too: [Google Dev Profile](https://developers.google.com/profile/u/CollinsKariuki).
